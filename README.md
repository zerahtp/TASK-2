# Web Scraping and Kafka Integration Project
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a web page, send it to a Kafka topic, save the data from Kafka to a file, and provide a REST API to access the saved data. The project is divided into three main parts: scraping and sending data to Kafka, consuming data from Kafka and saving to a file, and serving the data via a REST API.
